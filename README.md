👋🏻 Hi, I'm @dayraarocho.

👩🏻‍💻 I have a strong passion for computer programming.

🌱 Currently, I'm enrolled in a college program focused on Web Development & Design. Additionally, I'm actively progressing through the freecodecamp Responsive Web Design course. I'm excited about completing Udemy courses covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the near future.

🚀 I'm also self-learning Swift through YouTube courses, expanding my programming horizons.

💡 My journey in the programming world is all about continuous learning and growth. Looking forward to what's ahead!
